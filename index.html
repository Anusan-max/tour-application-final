      <h2>PLACES TO STAY</h2>
      <p>The island country just off of the coast of India is a wondrous spot for travelers. From dense rainforests 
        and euphoric sea shores to antiquated sanctuaries and stunning train journeys, Sri Lanka has a great deal 
        to offer â€“ and that is without referencing the kindness of its people and the flavor of the food.
        Lively and loaded with its own remarkable history and culture, Sri Lanka may have a solid association 
        with Southern India however with a quickly developing tourist scene and alluringly different landscape, 
        visiting Sri Lanka is getting progressively well known.</p>
      <p>Realizing where to stay in Sri Lanka relies upon what you want out of your trip. 
        If you just want to enjoy a week or more in a luxury beach resort under the shade of palm trees, head to Sri Lanka's well known sea shore resorts, for example, Unawatuna. 
        On the off chance that adventuring into hill-top towns with old relics is more your scene, Kandy is the spot 
        for you. At that point there's the modern vibrancy of the cosmopolitan pioneer capital Colombo, 
        with its enormous choice of accommodation.</p>
